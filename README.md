# Manageable

Manageable is a Carrd style landing page for my Luxembourgish company Manageable. Its actually of fork of one of my previous projects : the page I made for the artist [dronefactory](https://www.instagram.com/dronefactoryart/). I used an existing Bootstrap-ready HTML theme that I heavily modified. This is a HTML/CSS project but some Javascript was involved.

## Installation

Just fork and adapt it to your needs

## Usage
